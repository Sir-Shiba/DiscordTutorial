# DiscordTutorial
Tired of Python? This is a sample Discord Bot implemented in Node.js and TypeScript!

## TypeScript?
* TypeScript is vastly superior to JavaScript, trust me. It helps you catch a lot of errors because you need to compile it. If you're using TypeScript properly, you'll never run into type errors and "___ is undefined" kind of errors.

## Prerequisites
* Node.js installation (compatible with Discord.js)
* Package manager (typically NPM but there are other package managers out there like Yarn)
* Discord.js Bot Token

## Creating a New Bot (Without this template)
1. Initialize a node project using `npm init`
2. Install discord.js using `npm install discord.js`
3. Install dotenv using `npm install dotenv`
4. Code!

## Starting This Template Bot
1. Clone/fork this repo and go to this branch
2. Run `npm install` in the root directory (same level as `package.json`)
3. Create a .env file, copying the format of the .env.example file, and add the bot token
4. Transpile the code from TS to JS: `npm run build`
4. Run `npm start`

## Modifying This Template Bot
* Edit `./src/index.ts`, or create your own file structure
